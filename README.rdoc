= RightScraper

== DESCRIPTION

=== Synopsis

RightScraper provides a simple interface to download and keep repositories up-to-date
using various protocols.  It has been decomposed into various modules so that you
may specify only the functionality (and required libraries and gems) you require.
This gem depends on all available RightScraper modules, enabling full support at the
cost of requiring some systems administration work external to Ruby.
