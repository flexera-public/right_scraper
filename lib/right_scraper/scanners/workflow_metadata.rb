module RightScraper::Scanners

  # Load workflow metadata from a filesystem.
  class WorkflowMetadata < ::RightScraper::Scanners::Base
    # Begin a scan for the given workflow.
    #
    # === Parameters
    # workflow(RightScraper::Resources::Workflow):: workflow to scan
    def begin(workflow)
      @workflow = workflow
      @metadata_filename = File.basename(workflow.metadata_path)
    end

    # Notice a file during scanning.
    #
    # === Block
    # Return the data for this file.  We use a block because it may
    # not always be necessary to read the data.
    #
    # === Parameters
    # relative_position(String):: relative pathname for the file from root of workflow
    def notice(relative_position)
      if relative_position == @metadata_filename
        @logger.operation(:metadata_parsing) do
          @workflow.metadata = JSON.parse(yield)
        end
      end
    end

    # Notice a directory during scanning.  Since the workflow definition and
    # metadata live in the root directory we don't need to recurse,
    # but we do need to go into the first directory (identified by
    # +relative_position+ being +nil+).
    #
    # === Parameters
    # relative_position(String):: relative pathname for the directory from root of workflow
    #
    # === Returns
    # Boolean:: should the scanning recurse into the directory
    def notice_dir(relative_position)
      relative_position == nil
