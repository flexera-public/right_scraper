module RightScraper::Scanners

  # Base class for scanning filesystems.  Subclasses should override
  # #notice and may override #new, #begin, #end and
  # #notice_dir.
  #
  # Overriding #new is useful for getting
  # additional arguments.  Overriding #begin allows you to do
  # processing before the scan of a given resource begins;
  # overriding #end allows you to do processing after it completes.
  #
  # Most processing will occur in #notice, which notifies you that a
  # file has been detected, and in #notice_dir.  In #notice you are
  # handed the relative position of the file from the start of the
  # resource; so if you were scanning <tt>/a/resource</tt> and
  # noticed a file <tt>b/c</tt>, #notice would be called with
  # <tt>"b/c"</tt>, even though the full pathname is
  # <tt>/a/resource/b/c</tt>.  If you decide you need the actual
  # data, #notice takes a block which will return that data to you
  # if you +yield+.
  #
  # In #notice_dir you are handed the relative position of a
  # directory.  The return value determines whether you find the
  # directory worth recursing into, or not--as an example, when
  # looking for the <tt>metadata.json</tt> file it is never
  # necessary to descend past the topmost directory of the resource,
  # but the same is not true when building a manifest.

    # === Block ===
    # Return the data for this file.  We use a block because it may
    # not always be necessary to read the data.
    #
    # === Parameters ===
    # relative_position(String):: relative pathname for _pathname_
    #                             from root of resource

    # should recurse into the directory (the default behavior)

    # === Parameters ===
    # relative_position(String):: relative pathname for the directory
    #                             from root of resource
    #
    # === Returns ===
    # Boolean:: should the scanning recurse into the directory
